# json2query

I created this utility application as a bridge between Highcharts.js and Impala. Basically a JSON to SQL query converter, could be useful when dealing with charts and big data. 

Draft status. I still need to add a table matrix.

Apart from JUnit only dependency is Gson but any Json library would be fine.

Cheers!
